In this chapter, you will push your new Rails app to a Git repository.  I prefer GitHub for Rails apps because more continuous integration services and other tools are available for GitHub than for BitBucket or Gitlab.

## GitHub
* Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).  If you do not already have a GitHub account, sign up for one.
* In GitHub, create a new repository.  To avoid confusion, give it the same name as that of your new Rails app.  Use the default settings for all other options.
* Your new repository on GitHub will be empty initially.  Follow the instructions provided on how to push an existing repository from the command line.
